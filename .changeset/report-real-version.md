Report the real version. `veilio --version` and the MCP server's `serverInfo` both said 0.1.0 while 0.2.0 was installed - the number was typed into the source and never moved with a release. Both now read it from their own package. `veilio --help` also lists `team unlock` and `team lock`, which it had left out.
