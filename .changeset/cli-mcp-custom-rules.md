Apply the account's custom rules outside the browser. `veilio rules pull` fetches your personal and team rules and `veilio scrub` applies them offline, stating on each run how many it applied and how old the copy is; `logout` removes the copy. The MCP server fetches them at startup and states their source on every anonymize result. Before, rules set in the web app were ignored by both, so the same code was masked differently.
